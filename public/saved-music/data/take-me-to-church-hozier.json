        "That Rick Rubin annotation below is a super glowing endorsement. That’s really, really special. Thank you. His work with Johnny Cash I still go back to a lot of times, the American albums. I’m thrilled to hear that.\n\nA lot of the Johnny Cash stuff went over my head growing up, but it was around the time of the American albums I started to listen to him a bit more. Rob Kirwan, who produced my first album, is a big fan of the stuff he did with Rick Rubin, which is mixed with Andrew Scheps and which is one of the reasons we started working with Andrew Scheps.\n\nOne of my favorites is Johnny Cash’s version of ‘I See A Darkness’ – it’s absolutely gorgeously produced and recorded. It’s a Bonnie ‘Prince’ Billy track.”"

The question that follows is one directed to his bedmate. It’s meant to be said in a seductive way as they do in the movies when asking rhetorical questions about a partner’s body. The next four lines are emphasising his feelings about the bedmate."

He recorded a demo, he told The New York Times, “in my attic at 2 o'clock in the morning.” Someone at Rubyworks heard that version, which Hozier has called “a real homemade job.” The label paired him with producer Rob Kirwan, who helped overdub live instrumentation on the track, but encouraged Hozier to leave the powerful, original demo vocals."

It tells the story of two men, a same-sex couple, who face violence spurred by community homophobia.\n\nHozier said:\n\nThe song was always about humanity at its most natural and how that is undermined ceaselessly by religious organisations and those who would have us believe they act in its interests. What has been seen growing in Russia is no less than nightmarish, I proposed bringing these themes into the story and Brendan liked the idea."
