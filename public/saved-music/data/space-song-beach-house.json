After a breakup, your partner will not be around to comfort you – and after death, nobody will ever comfort you again.\n\nThis phrase was also used by Canadian rockers Destroyer in their track “Sun in the Sky” from their album Poison Season; both Depression Cherry and Poison Season were released on August 28, 2015."
