        "Before Mitski got famous she had a cheeky little hole in her window. This little black hole takes in a sweet breeze, and the smell of the peach tree that was outside her window at the time.\n\nSome people might interpret as if the hole is a metaphor for something or someone, that even tho someone is ruining something that would’ve been so clear and easy, that theres still is something sweet and nice in it.\n\nThat sweet breeze that comes from black hole in her window could also represent the little hope that comes in life every once in a while.\n\nThe “black hole” may refer to an empty space,  meaning that the person/lover who slept there is not there anymore. This would maybe help to understand why Mitski said afterwards “Wild women don’t get the blues.” It means she was sad and she could’ve been sad because her lover was no longer sleeping there."

        "This interlude almost feels like a momentary release, a brief surrender to the suffocating longing the narrator feels.\n\nModulation to a higher key in pop music is commonly understood to announce the song’s climactic finish (see Whitney Houston’s “I Will Always Love You” for a popular example). In most of these cases, the song either maintains the new key to its conclusion or modulates again to a higher key. Here, however, the key is only briefly maintained and is quickly cut off by the outro.\n\nMitski’s choice to return to the original key after modulating deprives the interlude of a satisfying resolution and instills a sense of disappointment in the listener. This mirrors the song’s themes of frustration. It is a momentary lapse of restraint anxiously interrupted by a return to denial."

      "annotation": [
        "Throughout the song Mitski references “crying like a tall child” and “I’ve grown in to a tall child”, the way I interpreted this line was that as a child you always say to your parents “I don’t want to go home yet” and her referencing that in the song is almost a childlike thing to say so it carries the theme of the song, of being an adult but still “acting” and feeling like a child.\n\nThe last line ties back to the “ledge” she’s found herself on. There’s some childlike sense of adventure in the idea of walking to the top of big night sky, but she doesn’t want to go home yet (feeling intoxicated) and wanders up to the top of the night sky (possibly related to the feeling like you’re high or like you’re floating when you’re in love), but it’s sandwiched between the chorus of feeling overwhelmed and too much, like you’re stuck up on a ledge way up high and need to be helped off. Like a child who’s in over their head."

        "Being a “tall child” can be interpreted as having a child like maturity or mind set while being stuck in Mitski’s adult body. In this statement, she could be saying that lately she (in her adult form) has been crying in a way she hasn’t since she was a child or in a manner that she associates as childish. Mitski continues to use this phrasing of “tall child” later in the song when she sings, “And I was so young when I behaved twenty five. Yet now I find I’ve grown into a tall child.\""

      "annotation": [
        "Here, Mitski explains how she felt more mature in her childhood than she does or did as an adult in this relationship. She is described as a “tall” child, meaning that she sees her self-worth as that of a child in an adult body. This showcases to us that the relationship she was/is in made her highly dependant (like a child). It could also mean that she finds herself being more emotional right now as an adult, than she ever did as a child.\n\nThe line “I was so young when I behaved twenty five” may also mean that people told her from a young age that she was very mature for her age so she adapted that into her personality in order to not disappoint them (we’ve seen from songs like “Real Men” that she’s learned to need male validation, so maybe a father figure pushed this idea on her and so she wanted to please them by acting the way they wanted her to). This led to her hiding her true feelings and probably missing out on on a lot from her childhood. Now that she she’s grown, she realises the trauma these people have caused her and so she tries to live these “childish” feeling she never was allowed to have."
