        "One of Smith’s more notable lyrical skills is his ability to convey so much with so little.\n\nThis line ‘And I’ll make you okay and drive them away’ brings many ideas of hysteria, a craving to run away, perhaps it emphasises Smith’s need for his alcoholic crutch to keep ‘them’  away because he is too weak to do so himself.\n\nGiving into this cycle of alcohol soothing him repeatedly with every swig is dangerous, it suggests Elliott it trapped in a cycle of apparent sanctity and is so deluded he cannot escape – But he doesn’t have to worry because the alcohol will ‘make you okay’. Sadly, of course, it doesn’t.\n\n‘The images stuck in your head’ tells us he is troubled. His past actions and horrible experiences he has undergone have plagued his mid with these ‘images stuck’ in his head.\n\n\n\n Just one of the many reasons Elliott not only wants but needs this drink."

        "The chorus like his battle with alcoholism is both repetitive and constant. It ends the song to show how he is stuck in the inescapable cycle of drinking that when it ends it simply begins again.\n\nThis becomes clear if the song is listened to on repeat as it literally fulfils this cycle, flowing seamlessly into the intro again."

There is no escaping the truth, and alcohol will always remember. As the saying goes: in vino veritas (there is truth in wine). Therefore the subject is stuck in a self-perpetuating cycle where he must drink to balm himself from life and his truths, yet the drink always remembers past truths he’s forgotten and so forces him to drink more as the repressed former memories are also liberated when he’s drunk."

        "This verse exhibits some of Smith’s most intricate and meticulous lyricism.\n\nThe first line refers to someone taking a swig from a bottle of alcohol and, thus, looking up towards the stars. The second line refers to the mouth of the bottle “kissing” his lips.\n\nThe line “between the bars” opens up many possible interpretations. It may refer to\n\n\nThe time in-between actual bars, where he bought the bottle and wanders to the next bar\nThe time in-between a music bar, often used to sip from a drink while performing\nBetween prison bars, further fleshing out the metaphor of addiction/alcoholism as a prison\n\n\n\nThe final two lines can be interpreted to support all three of these possibilities:\n\n\nSmith could be waving his hands, attempting to get the bartenders attention to order another drink\nSmith could be looking out on the cheering audience from his perch on the stage\nThe force of addiction is so strong, that even though Smith recognizes it as a prison, he still eagerly turns himself in"

        "Elliott is tortured by his past actions and ideas and uses alcohol as his coping mechanism. These past selves, whether they be healthy or detrimental, whether they caused him to love or lose love, are unbearable to him in his current state. Alcohol promises to numb their influence on him and “keep them still”, putting at rest a mind that is clearly buzzing with past turmoil. The notion of “bending to [his] will” also shows how Elliott feels helpless and yearns to be in control, preferring to repress these memories or feelings rather than let their possibility torture him."

        "The alcohol is speaking to him. The song is not about Elliott comforting a girl, but about alcohol comforting him. Here the alcohol tempts him telling him to stay up drinking.\n\nNoticeably the alcohol speaks to him in the voice of a temptress. Referring to him as ‘baby’ it takes on the role of forceful femme fatale almost seducing him into temptation by tantalisingly telling him of his potential: ‘the things you could do’ and the drunk persona he could adopt ‘you won’t but you might.’\n\nThe line “you won’t but you might” also has interesting connotations. It conveys this sense of known futility: even with the potential granted to him through his alcohol abuse, he still knows that he is not capable of achievement. However, he indulges because that feeling of possibility is still tantalizing, even if he’s implicitly given up on his own ability."
