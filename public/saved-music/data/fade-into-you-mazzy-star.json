The hands could represent a physical sign of affection that they are overriding with second thoughts; the speaker has to “hold the hand inside” them because their hands are in their head.\n\n“It’s smiles cover your heart” also implies that this person’s true feelings are difficult to read. In one line they seem like they are sad, but the next they are smiling. Their true intentions are masked."
