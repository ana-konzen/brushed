But despite this, the relationship qualms which prominently feature on his albums still exists here\n\nAn undeniable feeling; despite being at the pinnacle of a pop-culture zeitgeist, with even a summer named after the stated album, Troye can’t just ignore his incessant desire to remembered by his previous lovers, a feeling too hard for him to forget despite the parties best efforts"

        "Following on from the trend of facing past issues that begun through Lorde’s remix of BRAT’s tenth track, ’girl, so confusing’, Troye tackles his problem surrounding distant love and miscommunication, a concept that crept up most recently throughout his third studio album, ”Something To Give Each Other”\n\nThe miscommunication is at its apparent peak, within the aforementioned album, through both the low-tempo track 5, ’Still Got It’ and its subsequent ballad track of ’Can’t Go Back, Baby’, which sees Troye tackle his inner emotions of a long-lost relation, with him going on to state about track 5:\n\nAll those feelings are there, that familiarity and that sweetness. But there’s also this very strange distance.”\n\nBy the end of the album however, the distance still remains, going onto quote in the last track lines like ”wish you lived a little closer”; but by the last few lyrics, Troye leaves rather open-ended on what he wants in his future and ultimately what he wants in a partner, a point further expanded upon in an interview with Kane Lowe:\n\nThroughout all the experiences and people on the album, I still have this longing and desire to find a long-term relationship.” He goes on “[…] I still haven’t found the thing I’m looking for. It doesn’t negate these prior experiences and how beautiful they are, but I’m still looking. I thought it was a very real way to end it. I’m on this journey, I’m really happy and I’m enjoying every second of it, I’m so grateful for all the connections, and I’m curious to see what happens next.”\n\nIn this track, though, Troye begins to take back his sexual prerogative; giving his respective partner a ‘plan’ to follow, as well as flying them out to Amsterdam rather than just letting the distance maintain between them. In a fashion similar to the boldness, unashamed raw nature of BRAT, Troye is taking a note from Charli and finally trying to kill the distance that’s been persistent throughout his past relations.\n\n\n\nIn the Grammy U Talk, Troye says that this line was quite frankly inspired by a really nice, fancy hotel in the Netherlands that he got put up in for his GAP commercial shoot."
