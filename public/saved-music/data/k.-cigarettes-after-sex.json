Given that this song is about a long-distance relationship where he reminisces about the time they spent together before she went away, we can assume he gets jealous at the idea that other people see and talk to her."

        "I think there’s huge symbolism to this line given its phrasing and how it closes the chorus. Candles symbolize bringing light from darkness.\nWhen they are together, she brings some light and hope to him.\n\n“A candle, in order to fulfill itself, must burn itself out. If a candle is never lit, it never fulfills its purpose”.  This also means there is loss to lighting, and therefore burning, a candle.\n\nHe knows he can’t have her for forever and that by being with her in any way, there is also an element of loss to the lightness and hope she brings. By being with her too in their current state, there is loss just by virtue that he doesn’t have her all to himself."

        "Here, the writer reminisces about his time with Kristen. This proves how much he misses her. He puts her on a ‘podium’ and frames all his good memories of her. He does this so he can preserve her although she is no longer with him.\n\n“Pictures of you with flowers on the wall” may also be a play on words to “wallflowers” – a phrase describing shy people who prefer to observe than to actively participate, especially at dances."
