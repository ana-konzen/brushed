His anger issues got the best of him after his grandmother’s passing, resulting in him breaking the hearts of those around him. Another theory is that maybe this line represents the pain that brings the death of a close relative, friend or lover, it breaks the hearts of many, destroying lives without a care."

It can fade and blend in but at the end of the day it will always be there; a daily reminder of the pain they underwent. Her death has permanently lodged itself into the back of his head; something he will never be able to forget. Her death, all in all, has torn and stained the very fabric of their lives, like a blade will stain skin, forever."

He’s saying goodbye.\n\nSome people are taught to never say goodbye to someone you love because it is considered final. Instead, they use other phrases, like ‘goodnight,’ even if they will never wake up.\n\nThis could be referring to Gerard Way’s grandmother, who the song is written for after her passing. She may be gone, but it’s better if he doesn’t follow her."

Her giving up was her way of selling her life, not thinking about how it would affect her loved ones. He’s calling her selfish in a way.\n\nAlso, it can refer to watching a star “fall from grace”, meaning watching someone you love and idolize, like a singer/actor, slowly falling apart and being helpless cause you can’t stop it and in turn crying cause you know how it will end. Artist s live their lives in the public eye, they live through their arts… so they affect us greatly, because as fans we can relate to them in some form or another. They’d sell us their pain, so when they die they take a piece of us with them."

He’s holding on to pain as thick as blood on a knife blade.\n\nAlso, could mean he’s a “cutter”, people who self-mutilate,  replacing one pain by another. He’s fighting the urge to cut deeper and end it… he’s determined to make it though the night.\n\n Perhaps this could also be a reference to the grim reaper’s scythe if death is being personified."

Gerard uses the fire metaphor to allude to both his grandmother’s death and his own self-destructive behavior.\n\nGerard and Mikey’s grandmother, Elena Rush (or Helena), had a huge influence on Gerard’s musical career. She fed his and Mikey’s dreams and supported them in everything they did.\n\nOn the surface, Gerard seems angry for her leaving, as if she’s the reason why everyone is hurting.  However, these lyrics act as a letter to himself, expressing the self-hatred he felt at the time.\n\nWith this in mind, when he says “you,” he’s referring to himself.  He’s the one who struck the match."

Similarly, death is the only way he could be reunited with his grandmother. When he sings “you die to get in again,” he could mean he misses her so much he’d do anything to get her back again, perhaps even commit suicide.\n\n\n\nYears after the song’s release, MCR started offering t-shirts with a hearse graphic."
