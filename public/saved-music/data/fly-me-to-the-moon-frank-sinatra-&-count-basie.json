        "Kaye Ballard recorded this song first. Her recording was released by Decca Records in 1954.  Billboard (magazine) said that it was “A love song sung with feeling…” in a brief review published on 8 May 1954.\n\n\n\nThe girl fills him with a joy he has never had in his life before. She fills him with love and other powerful emotions he has never had and it makes him happy. He longs only to be her one and only, not her to be his. It’s true love."
